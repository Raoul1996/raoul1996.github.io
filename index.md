## Time

Money is not evil by itself 

Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways 

If not money – what is evil you may ask? 

Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more 

Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold 

at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist 

Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost 

Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again 

until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone 

Make more time 

I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful 

I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success 

Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling 

You can change today if you redefine what success is to you 

You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones 

You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you 

You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like 

You can re-balance your priorities in life 

You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible 

You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86 

but don’t wait until then… 

You will always be able to make more money 

But you cannot make more time
